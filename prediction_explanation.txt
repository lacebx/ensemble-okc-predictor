IMPORTANT NOTES
================================================================================

1. These predictions are based on statistical models and historical data.
2. Many factors not captured in statistics can affect outcomes:
   - Injuries and player availability
   - Rest days and schedule fatigue
   - Referee calls and game flow
   - Clutch performance and late-game execution
   - Matchup-specific strategies

3. OKC's exceptional 23-1 record (95.8% win rate) suggests they are:
   - One of the strongest teams in the league
   - Playing at an elite level consistently
   - Capable of winning against any opponent

4. If predictions seem conservative compared to OKC's record:
   - Model may be using insufficient opponent data
   - Model may be over-cautious due to small sample size
   - Recent form features may not fully capture OKC's dominance
   - Consider that even great teams lose occasionally

5. Error margins account for uncertainty, but actual outcomes may vary.
